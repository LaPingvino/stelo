// Clone copies the room's whole state — instances (their variables, alarms,
// timelines' positions), the step's pending room change and sleep, and the
// globals — so a copy can be stepped on its own (the play-check bot tries
// moves from saved states). Objects and timelines are definitions and are
// shared. It also returns each old instance's copy, for callers that keep
// instance pointers. The copy's globals have no sound.
